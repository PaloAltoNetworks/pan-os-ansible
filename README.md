Releasing, changelogs, versioning and deprecation

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is adhered to for this project.

Deprecations are done by version number, not by date or by age of release. Breaking change deprecations will only be made with major versions.

Support
-------

As of version 2.12.2, this Collection of Ansible Modules for PAN-OS is
[certified on Ansible Automation Hub](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos)
and officially supported for Ansible subscribers. Ansible subscribers can engage
for support through their usual route towards Red Hat.

For those who are not Ansible subscribers, this Collection of Ansible Modules is
also [published on Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/paloaltonetworks/panos)
to be freely used under an as-is, best effort, support
policy. These scripts should be seen as community supported and Palo
Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do
not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the
components of the project through our normal support options such as
Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers)
partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the
VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but
the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in
deploying or using the template or script itself.

Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub
repository (at <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks>) or sites other
than our official Downloads page on <https://support.paloaltonetworks.com>
are provided under the best effort policy.

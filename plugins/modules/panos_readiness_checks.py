module: panos_readiness_checks
short_description: Runs readiness checks (boolean in nature) against a Firewall device.
description:
    - A wrapper around the PAN-OS Upgrade Assurance package.
    - The module is meant to run readiness checks available in the package's CheckFirewall.run_readiness_checks()
      L(method,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall/#checkfirewallrun_readiness_checks).
      Since it's just a wrapper, the way you would configure a check is exactly the same as if you would run the class directly.
      Please refer to package's documentation for L(syntax,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/configuration-details/#readiness-checks)
      and L(configuration dialect,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/dialect/).
author: "Łukasz Pawlęga (@fosix)"
version_added: '2.18.0'
requirements:
    - pan-python can be obtained from PyPI U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pan-python)
    - pandevice can be obtained from PyPI U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandevice)
    - panos-upgrade-assurance can be obtained from PyPI U(https://pypi.org/project/panos-upgrade-assurance)
notes:
    - Panorama is not supported.
    - Check mode is not supported.

    checks:
        description:
            - A list of checks that should be run against a device. For the details on currently supported checks please refer to
              L(package's documentation,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/configuration-details/#readiness-checks).
            - In most of the cases it is enough to specify a check name to run it with default settings.
              In this case the list element is of type B(str). If additional configuration is required the element is a one element B(dict),
              where key is the check name and value contains the check's configuration. For information which check requires additional configuration
              please refer to L(package documentation,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/configuration-details/#readiness-checks).

            - When set to B(true) will skip the B(en_US.UTF-8) locales on the checks.

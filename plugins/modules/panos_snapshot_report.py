module: panos_snapshot_report
short_description: Generates a report by comparing two snapshot made with the M(paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_state_snapshot) module.
description:
    - A wrapper around the PAN-OS Upgrade Assurance package.
    - This is an 'offline' module, meaning it operates only on available facts. It does not need to connect to a device.
      It's a wrapper around the L(SnapshotCompare class, https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/snapshot_compare/#class-snapshotcompare).
    - The module takes two snapshots made with M(paloaltonetworks.panos.panos_state_snapshot) module, compares them and produces a report in a form of
      a B(dict). Keys in this report match the state areas, values contain comparison details.
    - You can limit the report to the state area's you're only interested in. You can also adjust the comparison by excluding some or
      limiting to particular properties.
    - Please refer to package's documentation for L(syntax,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/configuration-details/#readiness-checks)
      and L(configuration dialect,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/dialect/).
author: "Łukasz Pawlęga (@fosix)"
version_added: '2.18.0'
requirements:
    - pan-python can be obtained from PyPI U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pan-python)
    - pandevice can be obtained from PyPI U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandevice)
    - panos-upgrade-assurance can be obtained from PyPI U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/panos-upgrade-assurance)
notes:
    - This is an offline module, no device connection is made.
    - Check mode is not supported.

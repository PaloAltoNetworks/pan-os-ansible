module: panos_state_snapshot
short_description: Takes a snapshot of a state of a Firewall device.
description:
    - A wrapper around the PAN-OS Upgrade Assurance package.
    - The module takes a snapshot of a state of specified areas. It runs the package's CheckFirewall.run_snapshots()
      L(method, https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/api/check_firewall/#checkfirewallrun_snapshots).
      Since it's just a wrapper, the way you would configure snapshot area is exactly the same as if you would run the class directly.
      Please refer to package's documentation for L(syntax,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/configuration-details/#readiness-checks)
      and L(configuration dialect,https://pan.dev/panos/docs/panos-upgrade-assurance/dialect/).

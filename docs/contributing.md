### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute some code? Here's how to set up `pan-os-ansible` for local development.

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher, along with Ansible

   Development must be done using Python 3.6 or higher.  Ansible still technically
   supports Python 2.7, but all code should target Python 3.6 or higher.

2. Fork the `pan-os-ansible` repo on GitHub.

3. Create a top level directory for your work, for example `ansible-hacking`:

```
$ mkdir ansible-hacking
$ cd ansible-hacking/
```

3. Clone your fork locally, using a special directory name so that Ansible understands
   it as a collection:

```
$ mkdir -p ansible_collections/paloaltonetworks
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/pan-os-ansible.git ansible_collections/paloaltonetworks/panos
```

4. Create a playbooks directory, and add our top level directory to `ansible.cfg`:

   Adding our top level directory to `ansible.cfg` will interpret the directory
   `ansible_collections/paloaltonetworks/panos` as the collection
   `paloaltonetworks.panos` without us having to build and install the collection each
   time!

   You can add any test playbooks to the `playbooks/` directory.  Any
   `ansible-playbook` runs from this directory will pick up our custom `ansible.cfg`
   file.

```
$ mkdir playbooks
$ echo "[defaults]\ncollections_paths = .." > playbooks/ansible.cfg
``` 

5. Create a branch for local development

```
$ cd ansible_collections/paloaltonetworks/panos
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

6. Now you can make your changes locally, and test them out by running
`ansible-playbook` from the `playbooks/` directory.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass `ansible-test sanity`:

```
$ ansible-test sanity --local
```

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Publish a new release (for maintainers)

This workflow requires node, npm, and semantic-release to be installed locally:

```
$ npm install -g semantic-release@^17.1.1 @semantic-release/changelog@^5.0.1 @semantic-release/git@^9.0.0 @semantic-release/exec@^5.0.0 conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits@^4.4.0
```

### Test the release process

Run `semantic-release` on develop:

```
semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci --branches=develop
```

Verify in the output that the next version is set correctly, and the release notes are generated correctly.

### Merge develop to main and push

```
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

At this point, GitHub Actions builds the final release, and uploads it to Ansible Galaxy.

### Merge main to develop and push

Now, sync develop to main to add the new commits made by the release bot.

```
git fetch --all --tags
git pull origin main
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

Now you're ready to branch again and work on the next feature.

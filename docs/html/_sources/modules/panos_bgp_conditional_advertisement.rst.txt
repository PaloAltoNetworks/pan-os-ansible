panos_bgp_conditional_advertisement -- Configures a BGP conditional advertisement.
==================================================================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Use BGP to publish and consume routes from disparate networks.

In the PAN-OS GUI, this resource cannot be created without also creating at least one non-exist filter and one advertise filter. The API behaves a little differently; you can create the conditional advertisement itself, but the API will start throwing errors if you try to update it and there is not at least one non-exist filter and one advertise filter.

In order for a conditional advertisement to be valid, you must specify at least one non-exist and one advertise filter.

When modifying a BGP conditional advertisement, any filters attached are left as-is, unless *advertise_filter* or *non_exist_filter* are specified.




Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- pan-python can be obtained from PyPI https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pan-python
- pandevice can be obtained from PyPI https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandevice



Parameters
----------

  commit (type: bool)
    Commit configuration if changed.


  vr_name (type: str, default: default)
    Name of the virtual router; it must already exist and have BGP configured.

    See :ref:`panos_virtual_router <panos_virtual_router_module>`.


  advertise_filter (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use :ref:`panos_bgp_policy_filter <panos_bgp_policy_filter_module>` to define filters after creation.

    ------------

    Advertisement filter object returned by :ref:`panos_bgp_policy_filter <panos_bgp_policy_filter_module>`.


  non_exist_filter (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use :ref:`panos_bgp_policy_filter <panos_bgp_policy_filter_module>` to define filters after creation.

    ------------

    Non-Exist filter object returned by :ref:`panos_bgp_policy_filter <panos_bgp_policy_filter_module>`.


  enable (type: bool)
    Enable this policy.


  name (required, type: str)
    Name of Conditional Advertisement policy.


  used_by (type: list)
    List of Peer Groups using this policy.


  provider (type: )
    A dict object containing connection details.


    ip_address (type: str)
      The IP address or hostname of the PAN-OS device being configured.


    username (type: str, default: admin)
      The username to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


    password (type: str)
      The password to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


    api_key (type: str)
      The API key to use instead of generating it using *username* / *password*.


    port (type: int, default: 443)
      The port number to connect to the PAN-OS device on.


    serial_number (type: str)
      The serial number of a firewall to use for targeted commands. If *ip_address* is not a Panorama PAN-OS device, then this param is ignored.



  ip_address (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The IP address or hostname of the PAN-OS device being configured.


  username (type: str, default: admin)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The username to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


  password (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The password to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


  api_key (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The API key to use instead of generating it using *username* / *password*.


  port (type: int, default: 443)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The port number to connect to the PAN-OS device on.


  template (type: str)
    (Panorama only) The template this operation should target. Mutually exclusive with *template_stack*.


  template_stack (type: str)
    (Panorama only) The template stack this operation should target. Mutually exclusive with *template*.


  state (type: str, default: present)
    The state.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Checkmode is supported.
   - Panorama is supported.
   - PAN-OS connectivity should be specified using *provider* or the classic PAN-OS connectivity params (*ip_address*, *username*, *password*, *api_key*, and *port*).  If both are present, then the classic params are ignored.
   - If the PAN-OS to be configured is Panorama, either *template* or *template_stack* must be specified.




Examples
--------

        name: 'cond-rule-01'
        enable: true
        non_exist_filter: '{{ non_exist.panos_obj }}'
        advertise_filter: '{{ advertise.panos_obj }}'

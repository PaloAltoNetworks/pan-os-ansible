++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The documentation for the httpapi plugin, paloaltonetworks.panos.panos,  was malformed.

The errors were:

* ::

        1 validation error for PluginDocSchema
        doc -> plugin_name
          extra fields not permitted (type=value_error.extra)


File a bug with the `paloaltonetworks.panos collection <https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible/issues>`_ in order to have it corrected.

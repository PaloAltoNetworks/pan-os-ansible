    ip_address (type: str)
      The IP address or hostname of the PAN-OS device being configured.


    username (type: str, default: admin)
      The username to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


    password (type: str)
      The password to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


    api_key (type: str)
      The API key to use instead of generating it using *username* / *password*.


    port (type: int, default: 443)
      The port number to connect to the PAN-OS device on.


    serial_number (type: str)
      The serial number of a firewall to use for targeted commands. If *ip_address* is not a Panorama PAN-OS device, then this param is ignored.



  ip_address (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The IP address or hostname of the PAN-OS device being configured.


  username (type: str, default: admin)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The username to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


  password (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

  port (type: int, default: 443)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The port number to connect to the PAN-OS device on.


  state (type: str, default: present)
    The state.


  device_group (type: str, default: shared)
    (Panorama only) The device group the operation should target.


  vsys (type: str, default: vsys1)
    The vsys this object belongs to.


  rulebase (type: str)
    The rulebase in which the rule is to exist.  If left unspecified, this defaults to *rulebase=pre-rulebase* for Panorama.  For NGFW, this is always set to be *rulebase=rulebase*.


  uuid (type: str)
    The rule UUID.

    Note that this is currently more of a read-only field.

    Usage of the UUID cannot currently take the place of using the rule name as the primary identifier.


  target (type: list)
    Applicable for Panorama only.

    Apply this rule exclusively to the listed firewall serial numbers.


  negate_target (type: bool)
    Applicable for Panorama only.

    Negate the value for *target*.


  location (type: str)
    Position to place the rule in.


  existing_rule (type: str)
    - If *location=before* or *location=after*, this option specifies
  an existing rule name.  The rule being managed by this module will
  be positioned relative to the value of this parameter.
- Required if *location=before* or *location=after*.



  audit_comment (type: str)
    Add an audit comment to the rule being defined.

    This is only applied if there was a change to the rule.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Checkmode is supported.
   - Panorama is supported.
   - PAN-OS connectivity should be specified using *provider* or the classic PAN-OS connectivity params (*ip_address*, *username*, *password*, *api_key*, and *port*).  If both are present, then the classic params are ignored.

panos_nat_rule2 -- Manage a NAT rule
====================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

- Manage a policy NAT rule. - NOTE:  Even though this module supports *state=merged*, due to the
  complexity of the XML schema for NAT rules, changing a NAT rule's types
  using *state=merged* will likely result in an error.  Using *state=merged*
  will work as normal for simple operations, such as adding additional IP addresses
  to any of the listings or changing simple variable types.





Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- pan-python >= 0.16
- pan-os-python >= 1.7.3

    ------------

    The IP address or hostname of the PAN-OS device being configured.


  username (type: str, default: admin)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

    ------------

    The username to use for authentication.  This is ignored if *api_key* is specified.


  password (type: str)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

  uuid (type: str)
    The rule UUID.

    Note that this is currently more of a read-only field.

    Usage of the UUID cannot currently take the place of using the rule name as the primary identifier.


  target (type: list)
    Applicable for Panorama only.

    Apply this rule exclusively to the listed firewall serial numbers.


  negate_target (type: bool)
    Applicable for Panorama only.

- Required if *location=before* or *location=after*.



  audit_comment (type: str)
    Add an audit comment to the rule being defined.

    This is only applied if there was a change to the rule.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Checkmode is supported.
   - Panorama is supported.
   - PAN-OS connectivity should be specified using *provider* or the classic PAN-OS connectivity params (*ip_address*, *username*, *password*, *api_key*, and *port*).  If both are present, then the classic params are ignored.

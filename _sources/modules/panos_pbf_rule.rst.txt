    ------------

    The IP address or hostname of the PAN-OS device being configured.


  username (type: str, default: admin)
    **Deprecated**

    Use *provider* to specify PAN-OS connectivity instead.

  vsys (type: str, default: vsys1)
    The vsys this object belongs to.


  rulebase (type: str)

  uuid (type: str)
    The rule UUID.

    Note that this is currently more of a read-only field.

    Usage of the UUID cannot currently take the place of using the rule name as the primary identifier.

  location (type: str)
    Position to place the rule in.


  existing_rule (type: str)

- Required if *location=before* or *location=after*.



  audit_comment (type: str)
    Add an audit comment to the rule being defined.

    This is only applied if there was a change to the rule.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Checkmode is supported.
   - Panorama is supported.
   - PAN-OS connectivity should be specified using *provider* or the classic PAN-OS connectivity params (*ip_address*, *username*, *password*, *api_key*, and *port*).  If both are present, then the classic params are ignored.




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: add a pbf rule
      panos_pbf_rule:
        provider: '{{ provider }}'
        name: 'my-pbf'
        description: 'Made by Ansible'
        from_value: ['myZone']
        action: 'discard'
